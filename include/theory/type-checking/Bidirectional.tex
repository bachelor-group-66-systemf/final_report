\begin{itemize}
    \item popular for its scalability, error reporting, and ease of implementation \citep{bidir-gadts}.
    \item Bidirectional type checking uses two modes: type checking and type synthesis. Checking is easier and allows for a more expressive type system but it requires explicit annotations. Synthesizing a program is harder and undecidable for some language features \citep{bidir}.
    \item The combination of checking and synthesizing means that there are multiple ways to create a typing judgment. For example, there are eight different rules for a judgment with two premises and one conclusion \citep{bidir}.   
   \item Dunfield and Krishnaswami \citep{bidir} defined general design criteria for a bidirectional type system. The design criteria are:
   \begin{itemize}
       \item Mode-correctness, no guessing of types.
       \item Completeness, all terms match at least one of the rules.
       \item Size, fewer rules are easier to work with.
       \item Annotation character, sensible annotations. Annotations should be lightweight, predictable, stable, and legible.
   \end{itemize}
   \item \citep{bidir} also presented a method for creating such a typing system, which is an alteration of the Pfenning recipe \citep{pfenning-recipe}. 
   The typing rules are divided into two forms of rules: introduction and elimination rules. Introduction rules introduce a connective in the conclusion, while an elimination rule eliminates a connective present in one of the premises. A connective connects multiple formulas, for instance, abstraction $\lambda x. e$ and let expressions $let x = e in e'$.
   \item Subsumption is an extra checking rule which accepts synthesizable expressions such as application $e_1 e_2$ \citep{bidir}. This is possible due to checking containing more information than synthesizing. Changing in the other direction is thus not possible.
