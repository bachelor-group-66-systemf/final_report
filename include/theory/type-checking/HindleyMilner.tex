\begin{itemize}
    \item The Hindley-Milner type system presents a fairly simple way system for type inference and type checking in polymorphic lambda calculus.
    \item One advantage is complete type inference, no annotations are required at all
    \item It has show faily simple to extend to user defined data types as well as case expressions.
    \item Error messages are hard to report well, as an ill-typed program is first detected in the unification part
\end{itemize}

\emph{This text assumes we have already argued for why a type system is favourable}
