The Curry-Howard correspondence relates the simply typed $\lambda$-calculus 
to intuitionistic logic \citep{smolka-notes}. 
The correspondence describes the construction and deconstruction of types, for instance,
the function connective $\rightarrow$ constructs a function \citep{howard-1980}.
In logic, this corresponds to introduction and elimination rules. Also, the function connective $\rightarrow$ corresponds to implication $\implies$.

Type systems can be designed by combining introduction and elimination rules.
For example, abstraction $\lambda x.e$ and application $e_1 e_2$ can be type checked by the introduction and elimination rules for $\rightarrow$. 
\begin{center}
\vskip 1em
\AxiomC{$\Gamma, (x : A) \vdash e : B$}
\RightLabel{$\rightarrow$I}
\UnaryInfC{$\lambda x.e : A \rightarrow B$}
\DisplayProof
\hskip 1.5em
\AxiomC{$\Gamma \vdash e_1 : A \rightarrow B$}
\AxiomC{$\Gamma \vdash e_2 : A$}
\RightLabel{$\rightarrow$E}
\BinaryInfC{$e_1 e_2 : B$}
\DisplayProof
\vskip 1em
\end{center}
The judgments use the form $\Gamma \vdash e : A$, read "in context $\Gamma$, term e has type A". 
$\Gamma$ gives the type of the free variables in $e$, and
the notation $\Gamma , (x : A)$ is the context that extends $\Gamma$ by associating the identifier $x$ with type $A$.
Notice that the introduction rule introduces the connective
in the conclusion, while the elimination rule eliminates it from the premises. 
The type-checking algorithm can be mechanically derived from the rules. To check if the abstraction $\lambda x.e$ has type $A \rightarrow B$: extend the context with $x : A$ and check if the proposition $e : B$ holds.
Similarly, the application $e_1 e_2$ have type $B$ if $e_1$ and $e_2$ have type $A \rightarrow B$ and $A$ respectively.
