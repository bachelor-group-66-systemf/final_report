\begin{itemize}
    \item It can be difficult to extend a type system to add a language feature.
    Early in the project, a simple type checker was implemented following the recipe \cite{bidir}.
    When it was time to add polymorphism the whole type checker was redesigned. The new design 
    was implemented according to \cite{bidir-higher}. On the other hand, adding algebraic data types to the system was possible. However, features such as GADTs, dependent types, and linear types would probably necessitate big changes.
    \item Syntatic sugar is coniven
